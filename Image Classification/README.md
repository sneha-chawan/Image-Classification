NOTE:

I have done my project on colab and since colab has runtime disconnection issue, I have made 4 different notebooks, one for every model.

The filename of every notebook says the model name.

552_Final_Project__CNN : This notebook has code for augmentation, preprocessing and CNN + MLP model

552_Final_project_EfficientNet: This notebook has code for augmentation, preprocessing and EfficientNetBO model

552_Final_Project_ResNet : This notebook has code for augmentation, preprocessing and ResNet50 model

552_Final_Project_VGG: This notebook has code for augmentation, preprocessing and VGG16 model
